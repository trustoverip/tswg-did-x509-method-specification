**Abstract:**

The `did:x509` method aims to achieve interoperability between existing X.509 solutions and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) to support operational models in which a full transition to DIDs is not achievable or desired yet. It supports X.509-only verifiers as well as DID-based verifiers supporting this DID method.
