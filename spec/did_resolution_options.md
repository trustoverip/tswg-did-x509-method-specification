## DID resolution options

This DID method introduces a new DID resolution option called `x509chain`:

Name: `x509chain`

Value type: string

The value is constructed as follows:

1. Encode each certificate `C` that is part of the chain as the string `b64url(DER(C))`.

2. Concatenate the resulting strings in order, separated by comma `","`.
